# L-Band Satellite Tracking

## Introduction
Made for the L-Band Satellite Tracking and Characterization System project as part of Virginia Techs Major Design Experience (MDE) 4805/4806. This repository includes a Python-based GUI front-end used for effective tracking and data visualization.

## Running the Application
- **Pre-compiled Application:** Users can run the application directly from the executable in the root directory.
- **Python Files:** To run or modify the Python files, follow the installation instructions below.

## Installation
**Prerequisites:**
- Python 3.x

**Dependencies:**
- PyQt5
- PyQtGraph
- Matplotlib
- Numpy
- Folium

**Installation Commands:**
```bash
pip install PyQt5 pyqtgraph matplotlib numpy folium
```
## Usage

### Installation and Setup
1. **Download Application**: Obtain the application from the [GitHub repository](https://github.com/Ethancd19/L-Band-satellite-tracking).

### Using the GUI
1. **Run the Application**: Launch the application by running it from the desktop or the location where the file is saved on your machine.
2. **Calibration**: Calibrate your system on the first page, with the option to manually input coordinates.
3. **Scheduled Tracking**: Manage tracking schedules and control tracking operations.
4. **Fixed AZ-EL Recording**: Utilize static recording for specific azimuth and elevation.
5. **Graphing**: Visualize data through graphing features post-recording.
6. **Settings Adjustments**: Modify tuner mode and system power settings as necessary.

## For Future MDE Design Teams
